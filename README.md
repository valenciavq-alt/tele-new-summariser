### "No messages available"
- Bot can only see messages after it was added to the group
- Wait for more conversation, then try again

### Anthropic API Errors - Complete Troubleshooting Guide

#### 🔍 Error: 404 Model Not Found

If you're seeing errors like `Error 404: model 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' not found` or `Model not available`:

**What this means:** Your API key doesn't have access to the specific Claude model being used.

**✅ Solution (Follow in order):**

**Step 1: Delete the CLAUDE_MODEL environment variable (MOST COMMON FIX)**

The bot now defaults to **Haiku** (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`), which works for ALL API tiers.

- **Railway:**
  1. Go to your project → Variables tab
  2. Look for `CLAUDE_MODEL` variable
  3. If it exists, click the trash icon to DELETE it
  4. Bot will auto-redeploy with Haiku as default

- **Render:**
  1. Go to your service → Environment tab
  2. Look for `CLAUDE_MODEL` variable
  3. If it exists, delete it
  4. Click "Save Changes"

**Step 2: Verify the fix in deployment logs**

After redeployment, check logs for:
- ✅ Success: `✓ Using default Claude model: claude-3-haiku-20240307 (Haiku - works for all API tiers)`
- ❌ Still an issue: `⚠️ CLAUDE_MODEL environment variable is SET to:` (variable still exists)

**Step 3: Verify API key access in Anthropic Console**

1. Visit **[Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)**
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
   - Verify your API key is active
   - Check the creation date (keys don't expire but can be deleted)
4. Go to **Settings → Billing**
   - Confirm you have a valid payment method
   - Check your current balance and usage
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded spending limits
5. Go to **Settings → Organization**
   - Check your API tier/plan
   - Some models require higher tiers

**Step 4: Check which models are available to your account**

Unfortunately, Anthropic doesn't provide a direct UI to see available models, but you can:

1. **Check API tier:** Most new free accounts have access to Haiku
2. **Test via API Console:** Visit [Anthropic Workbench](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench) and try different models
3. **Model availability by tier:**
   - ✅ **All tiers:** `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (DEFAULT)
   - ⚠️ **Higher tiers may be needed for:** Sonnet and Opus variants
   - ⚠️ **Special access required:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (20240620, 20241022)

**Step 5: Alternative - Try different models (if Haiku doesn't work)**

Set `CLAUDE_MODEL` environment variable to one of these (in order of likelihood to work):

```
claude-3-haiku-20240307     ← Try this first (DEFAULT)
claude-3-sonnet-20240229    ← Try this second
claude-3-opus-20240229      ← Try this third
```

#### 🔑 Error: 401 Unauthorized / Authentication Failed

**What this means:** There's an issue with your Anthropic API key.

**✅ Solutions:**

1. **Verify API key is correct:**
   - Go to [Anthropic Console → API Keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
   - Check if your key is listed and active
   - API keys start with `sk-ant-api03-`
   - If unsure, create a new API key

2. **Check environment variable:**
   - Go to deployment platform (Railway/Render)
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Check for extra spaces, quotes, or characters
   - Copy-paste directly from Anthropic Console

3. **Verify billing setup:**
   - Go to [Anthropic Console → Billing](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing)
   - Ensure valid payment method is added
   - Confirm you have available credits
   - Check if spending limits are set

#### ⏱️ Error: 429 Rate Limit / Quota Exceeded

**What this means:** You've hit API usage limits or run out of credits.

**✅ Solutions:**

1. **Wait and retry** - Rate limits reset quickly (usually within minutes)
2. **Check usage:** [Anthropic Console → Usage](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage)
3. **Add more credits** if balance is low
4. **Consider upgrading** API tier for higher limits
5. **Reduce bot usage** - Use longer MESSAGE_LIMIT intervals

#### 🔧 Error: 500/503 Service Error

**What this means:** Temporary issue with Anthropic's API service.

**✅ Solutions:**

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** and try again
2. **Check status:** [Anthropic Status Page](https://status.anthropic.com/)
3. **Review Twitter:** [@AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI) for announcements
4. If persistent (>30 min), contact Anthropic support

### Quick Diagnosis Checklist

Run through this checklist to identify your issue:

- [ ] Check deployment logs for specific error codes
- [ ] Verify `CLAUDE_MODEL` environment variable is NOT set (let bot use Haiku default)
- [ ] Confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is correct and active
- [ ] Check Anthropic billing has valid payment method
- [ ] Verify you have available API credits
- [ ] Ensure bot is using `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (see logs)
- [ ] Test API key in [Anthropic Workbench](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench)
- [ ] Check [Anthropic Status](https://status.anthropic.com/) for service issues

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Check deployment logs** - They contain detailed error information
2. **Review environment variables** - Ensure all are set correctly
3. **Test in Anthropic Console** - Verify your API key works there
4. **Contact Anthropic Support** - For API tier and model access questions
5. **See detailed setup guide** - [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**⚠️ Key Reminder:** The bot defaults to **Haiku** which should work for ALL API tiers. Only set `CLAUDE_MODEL` if you specifically need a different model and have verified access.
