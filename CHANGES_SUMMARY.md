## üìù Overview

This update addresses persistent 404 model errors by switching to **Claude Haiku** (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`), the most basic and universally available Claude model, and significantly improves error handling to help users troubleshoot API key and model access issues.

---

## ‚ú® Major Changes

### 1. **Default Model Changed: Opus ‚Üí Haiku**

**Previous:** `claude-3-opus-20240229`  
**New:** `claude-3-haiku-20240307` ‚≠ê

**Why Haiku?**
- ‚úÖ Available to **ALL API tiers** (including free accounts)
- ‚úÖ **10-20x cheaper** than other models ($0.0001-0.0005 per summary)
- ‚úÖ **Fastest** response times
- ‚úÖ Still provides excellent summary quality
- ‚úÖ Should eliminate 404 model errors for most users

**Cost Comparison:**
- Haiku: 1000 summaries ‚âà $0.10-0.50
- Sonnet: 1000 summaries ‚âà $3-15
- Opus: 1000 summaries ‚âà $15-75

**Error Message Example:**
```
‚ùå Sorry, I encountered an error while generating the summary.

üîç Error Type: Model Not Found (404)

Model attempted: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
Error details: [error message]

This means: Your API key doesn't have access to this specific Claude model.

‚úÖ Recommended Solutions:

1. Check if CLAUDE_MODEL environment variable is set:
   ‚Ä¢ Go to your deployment platform (Railway/Render)
   ‚Ä¢ Look in Environment Variables section
   ‚Ä¢ If CLAUDE_MODEL exists, DELETE it to use the default (Haiku)
   ‚Ä¢ Haiku (claude-3-haiku-20240307) should work for all API tiers

2. Verify model availability in Anthropic Console:
   ‚Ä¢ Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
   ‚Ä¢ Check which models are available to your account
   ‚Ä¢ Ensure you have sufficient API credits

### 3. **Improved Logging**

Added enhanced startup logging:

**Success (no override):**
```
‚úì Using default Claude model: claude-3-haiku-20240307 (Haiku - works for all API tiers)
```

**Warning (override detected):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CLAUDE_MODEL environment variable is SET to: claude-3-opus-20240229
   This will override the default model (Haiku) in the code!
   If you're experiencing 404 errors, DELETE this environment variable!
```

This makes it immediately obvious in logs if an environment variable is causing issues.
